Author: Jonathan Finger

Date: 2/24/2020

I built a machine learning  model using data from Nature's 2019 survey of Ph.D. students.  The project is: (a) data processing and variable selection; (b) basic model assembly; (c) hyper-parameters tuning; (d) model interpretation and outputs

Included files:

A dataset used for model building obtained from Natureâ€™s website.

.ipynb jupyter notebook containing code.
